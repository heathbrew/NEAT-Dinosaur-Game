# NEAT Dinosaur Game

Welcome to the NEAT Dinosaur Game project! This repository contains experiments with the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm applied to a simple Dinosaur game implemented using Pygame. NEAT is a genetic algorithm developed by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen for evolving artificial neural networks.



## About NEAT

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a powerful neuroevolution technique used to evolve artificial neural networks. It enables the automatic generation and evolution of neural network architectures, making it particularly well-suited for complex tasks like game playing and control systems.

## Project Features

- Integration of NEAT algorithm with a Dinosaur game.
- NEAT model configuration and setup.
- Model visualization for understanding the evolving networks.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neat-dinosaur-game.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame neat-python
   ```

3. Run the Dinosaur game with NEAT:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To experiment with NEAT in the Dinosaur game, you can:

- Customize the game parameters and obstacles in `main.py`.
- Adjust the NEAT configuration in `neat_config.txt`.
- Visualize the evolving neural networks using the provided visualization tools.

## NEAT Configuration

The NEAT configuration can be fine-tuned in the `neat_config.txt` file. Feel free to modify these parameters to optimize the evolution process for your specific game.

## Model Visualization

This repository includes tools to visualize the evolving NEAT models. You can track the progress of neural network generations and observe how they improve their gameplay over time.
